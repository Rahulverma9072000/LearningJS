Second Pillar of JavaScript : Scopes 

Scopes : It actually represents visibility : variables and functions 
Scopes tell you where the things are visible 

Everything : variables and functions 
Everything inside your code will be used in one of the following 2 ways : 
 -> Either it will be getting some values assigned to it .
 -> Or Some values will be retrieved from it .


## Question : Do you think JavaScript is Compiled or Intrepreted ? 

What is Compiled language ? There is Something as Compiler : It read whole code altogether it checks if there is some error in your code . And eventually throws all your error , if no error and allows you to run the code .

What is Intrepreted language ? Intrepreter : It start reading the code line by line and if the current line has error than it does not move forward .

So JavaScript is Compiled or Intrepreter ?

What is Scope ? 

Scope determines where variable can be accessed in your program . Think of it like a boundary . Variable defined in 1 part of your code may not be visible elsewhere . 

There are several types of scope in JavaScript :  
1) Global Scope : A global variable is declared outside any function or block , making it available everywhere in your code . Be Careful with global variables : too many of them can make your code hard to manage . 
2) Local Scope (including fucntion scope) : 
3) Block-level scope (using let and const )
